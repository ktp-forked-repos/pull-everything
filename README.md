This is a small script which can be run like this:

    fetch-everything folder
    pull-everything folder

The script will search the folder for any git repositories and fetch/pull on them.

This is a great way for updating your Vim plugins in a dated `.vim/bundle` folder.

Also useful if you are going to travel and want to have your repositories synced on your work/personal laptop and Github.
